# Visual-Search-using-CNN-and-LSTM
We created a simple visual search application that is able to search through a dataset of images and look for images that match what the user is looking for using image captioning algorithm using a Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), on the output of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
